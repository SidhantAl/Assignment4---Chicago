#### Content

##### Ontology

All 4 students are attending the University of Rochester, all are dual majors and are currently taking Advanced Front-End Development. 

##### Difference

One student is a girl, her majors are CS and Psychology  

The student who is different will have a separate color scheme to the page, with more emphasis on the differences. The tab for this student will also be colored differently to strike a difference between the other students.

##### Choreography

The description of the students follows general information (summary), Academic experience and Work experience. The tabs on the navigation bar are last names of the students in ascending order apart from the home page.


#### Layout

The general information will contain in a section tag and will be center aligned below a picture on top of the article and aside tags. 

The home page will contain center aligned pictures of the 4 students with a brief 2 sentence description of their background. In addition to this, the home page will contain information about the website and inform users about the form.

The individual pages will contain an aside and an article tag, the aside tag will contain the Work Experience and will be positioned to the right of the page. While the article tag will be on the left-hand side of the page, containing the Academic Experience. 


#### Typefaces and Fonts 

H1 tags for the content, titles and names should be styled in a large, bold and highly legible font

H2 tags are to be used for subtitles and should be in italics for a more subtle look to the page. In addition to this, subtitles should be in a dark grey color.

P and regular content tags should be a thin font with adequate spacing in a dark color to be easy to read. 

*Background color changes to a light shade or white, depending on the designers preference*

#### Form

There will be a left aligned header on the form saying "Tell us about yourself", the input elements will follow below the header with adequate spacing between themselves.  

The form will contain 4 elements 

- Name (text input)
- Major 1 (text input)
- Major 2 (text input) - the user can put N/A if not applicable
- Class year (numeric input)

A submit button to add details to the database and present a table with all the content of the form to the user.

The table will contain 5 columns (number, name, major1, major2 and class year) and the rows will depend on the number of submissions on the form.


#### Next Steps 

- Designer will select a font and implement the design of the webpages with help from the coder. 
- Coder will set up the database and the form with help from the AI and Designer
- AI will check to see that the website follows the desired outlook, coordinating with the Designer and Coder
