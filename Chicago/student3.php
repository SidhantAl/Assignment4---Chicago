                <p>My name is Jovan Gianni Lee and am from Bronx, New York and went to St Raymond High School for Boys an all male Catholic School also located in the Bronx. Catholic School seemed to prepare me a little better compared another or pviate shcool by helping provide a structure and discipline.

                <h2>Academic Experience</h2>
                <p>During my time at Rochester my major has changed numerous times I went from an Computer Science Major to a Mathematics and Statistics Major To a Philosophy major and eventually I've decided to come back to the dark side and not only major in Philosophy but also add Computer Science with a minor in Political science. I hope that that my future plans include to go onto to earn a masters and perhaps the studies of the Ethical Issues within Computing. Combining my Philosophy Degree with my Computer Science degree. Is one of the biggest goals that I have and I believe I learned more about changing my mindset in order to code and have become a much better coder because of my study of philosophy.If this fails I can always go onto law school or do something with my political Science minor. I have worked throughout the summers volunteering at many organizations including the New York Police Department and as a camp counselor with the YMCA of Hugenot New york. I had my first official internship as a computer science student in the summer between my sophomore and junior year.</p>
