                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>I am a Junior at the University of Rochester, currently taking Advanced Front-End. I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Digital Media Studies, which provides the unique intersection of engineering and creative arts. Studying to be a software engineer, my academic and professional experience has given me a strong understanding of both the technical and user experience sides of a product.</p>

                <h2>Academic Experience</h2>
                <p>My academic career has had an interesting change of pace. I came in as a freshman with the intent of majoring in Digital Media Studies and Environmental Science. As a result, I spent my freshman year taking mainly Biology and Chemistry courses. The spring semester of my freshman year I took CSC 161 in order to fulfill a Digital Media Studies Requirement; this was my first introduction programming. One of my favorite courses has been New Media and Emerging Practices, were I got to continue my exploration of digital art.</p>

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>During my short career as a computer scientist I have worked at two different startups: Shareaholic and Drift. Both of the Boston based companies develop web applications. Shareaholic main product is a toolbar widget that different websites can install which allow there visitors to share their content on their social media. This one-click model can share to a variety of social media sites, catering to all different parts of the world. My time spent at Shareaholic was as a “Publisher Support Analyst”– which mainly functioned in the customer support role.</p>
