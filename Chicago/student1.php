                <h2>Academic Experience</h2>
                <p>I am currently double majoring in psychology and computer science, which gives me 2 different sets of problem-solving techniques. My academic background in computational coding inspired me a lot when I do behavior coding and helps me coming up with ways to optimize the coding system. Also, due to the nature of most of the computer science classes, I have a lot of experience working on teams for projects.</p>

                <p>I have been doing volunteer work since I was 13. I had experience of teaching in summer school when I was 16. Also, in high school I started up a project to help out the local orphanage by organizing volunteers visiting the orphanage once a week and plan activities to raise money for the kids. I also had experiences working with families when I was a research assistant. I enjoy working with kids and have the ability to answer parentsâ€™ concerns in a professional setting.</p>
