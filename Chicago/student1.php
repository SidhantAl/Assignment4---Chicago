                <h3>General Information</h3>
                <p>I'm currently taking Advanced Front-End. I'm originally from Iowa and my ethnic heritage consists of quarter Indian, quarter German, and half Russian. My father is an alum of MIT and has high expectations of me, as any father would be. My mother is fully Russian, and I have visited Russia quite a few times. Sadly, I do not speak Russian nor Hindi, and cannot speak easily with my Russian family. I do, however, speak French. I started learning French at the age of four from a tutor in my hometown, and have spoken it ever since. </p>

                <h3>Academic Experience</h3>
                <p>During my time at Rochester my major has changed numerous times I went from an Computer Science Major to a Mathematics and Statistics Major To a AME major and eventually I've decided to come back to major in AME and Computer Science with a minor in Political science. I hope that that my future plans include to go onto to earn a masters and perhaps the studies of the Ethical Issues within Computing. Combining my AME Degree with my Computer Science degree. Is one of the biggest goals to become a much better coder because of my study of computer science.</p>

                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>Outside of academics, I am a freelance audio engineer and created BoredProductions.ml to display my work. I included a few words about why audio engineering is necessary, just so potential clients are convinced. Over the break, I developed TranceFestival, a website displaying all the events and festivals corresponding to the genre of electronic music called “trance.” The website, unfortunately, is hardcoded HTML tables with PHP includes. I hope to improve the site CSS and understand the basics of MySQL databases so I can covert the Google Sheet into a MySQL database for easy table data addition.</p>
