                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>My name is May, I'm currently taking Advanced Front-End. I am from Bronx, New York and went to St Raymond High School for girls an all female Catholic School also located in the Bronx. Catholic School seemed to prepare me a little better compared another or pviate shcool by helping provide a structure and discipline. I did not initially mean to go to Rochester, I applied to many universities including SUNYs and CUNYs but only chose Rochester because they were one of the few Universiites in the NorthEast that offered a Naval Program for ROTC (NROTC). </p>

Is one of the biggest goals that learned more about changing my mindset in order to code and have become a much better coder because of my study of Business.</p>
