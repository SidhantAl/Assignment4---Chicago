        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>I’m originally from Iowa and my ethnic heritage consists of quarter Indian, quarter German, and half Russian. My father is an alum of MIT and has high expectations of me, as any father would be. My mother is fully Russian, and I have visited Russia quite a few times. Sadly, I do not speak Russian nor Hindi, and cannot speak easily with my Russian family. I do, however, speak French. I started learning French at the age of four from a tutor in my hometown, and have spoken it ever since. I am the only one in my family that speaks French, though, and have used that to my advantage when visiting France with my family. Since my family is multicultural and multinational, I have visited many countries. I have visited, as of today, Canada, Russia, England, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland. </p>

        <h2>Academic Experience</h2>
        <p>During my time at Rochester my major has changed numerous times I went from an Computer Science Major to a Mathematics and Statistics Major To a AME major and eventually I've decided to come back to the dark side and not only major in AME but also add Computer Science with a minor in Political science. I hope that that my future plans include to go onto to earn a masters and perhaps the studies of the Ethical Issues within Computing. Combining my Philosophy Degree with my Computer Science degree. Is one of the biggest goals that I have and I believe I learned more about changing my mindset in order to code and have become a much better coder because of my study of philosophy.If this fails I can always go onto law school or do something with my political Science minor. I have worked throughout the summers volunteering at many organizations including the New York Police Department and as a camp counselor with the YMCA of Hugenot New york. I had my first official internship as a computer science student in the summer between my sophomore and junior year.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>Outside of academics, I am a freelance audio engineer and created BoredProductions.ml to display my work. I included a few words about why audio engineering is necessary, just so potential clients are convinced. Over the break, I developed TranceFestival, a website displaying all the events and festivals corresponding to the genre of electronic music called “trance.” The website, unfortunately, is hardcoded HTML tables with PHP includes. I hope to improve the site CSS and understand the basics of MySQL databases so I can covert the Google Sheet into a MySQL database for easy table data addition. I decided to also make a portfolio website, AlexanderPunj.ml, to display my work. I post the work of my audio engineering and my web development projects. My work is quite varied so collecting it onto one site makes it easier for potential employers. In terms of work, there isn’t much to say. In the summers between grades in high school, I interned at my father’s company Insultec, Inc. This company works in the construction engineering field. They supply insulation (fiberglass and or foam) for power plants around the world. The company has offices in England, Egypt, South Korea, Puerto Rico, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and the US. I interned in the US office, as it was located in my hometown. There, I was a data analyst for the company. I made spreadsheets to collect data from power plant drawings, and then calculated how much fiberglass is needed in each part of the plant. In the summers between college years, I taught tennis lessons to local young players.</p>
